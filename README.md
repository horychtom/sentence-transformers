# Sentence-Transformer with W&B Logging, Hugging Face Trainer, Lora, and PEFT Techniques

This repository is a fork of the Sentence-Transformer library, adapted to integrate several new techniques such as W&B (Weights & Biases) logging, Hugging Face Trainer, Lora, and PEFT for enhancing the capabilities of sentence embeddings.

## Overview

This fork extends the functionalities of the Sentence-Transformer library by incorporating various features and techniques:

- **Weights & Biases (W&B) Logging**: Enables seamless integration with W&B for experiment tracking and visualization, offering improved model training insights and performance monitoring.

- **Hugging Face Trainer Integration**: Utilizes the Hugging Face Trainer for better model training control, allowing easy experimentation with various models, optimizers, and learning schedules.

- **Lora**: Incorporates Lora techniques for enhanced natural language understanding, which may include specific pre-processing, fine-tuning methods, or model adjustments for better performance.

- **PEFT (Potential Energy Fine-Tuning)**: Implements PEFT techniques, a novel approach for fine-tuning sentence embeddings to improve semantic representation.
